# MathQuest: Heroes of the Realm
**MathQuest: Heroes of the Realm** is a full-stack Java GUI application that merges medieval adventure with problem-solving, that I created during the summer of 2021. Players can summon heroes and items, defeat enemies by solving math equations, and manage their resources as they battle creatures from goblins to dragons.

## Features
- **Custom Graphics**: All characters, items, and enemies feature custom graphics designed within the game.
- **Summoning System**: Players can summon new items and characters to strengthen their arsenal.
- **Inventory Management**: A dedicated inventory page where players can view all the items they have acquired.
- **Blackjack Mini-Game**: Players can gamble their in-game credits in a game of blackjack.
- **Guidebook**: This page includes:
  - Player stats
  - Gacha summon percentages
  - Enemy information (types and characteristics)
  - Damage multipliers
- **Simple Controls**: Mouse input for navigation and interactions, with keyboard support for text input.
